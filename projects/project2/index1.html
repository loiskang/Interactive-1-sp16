    	<p>Ever since I was a kid, I loved to draw and I knew from the beginning I wanted to do something with art as I grew up. From Elementary to Junior High to High school, I took art lessons and I drew and painted on a daily. While I was applying for colleges, I was interested in abstract paintings and I created many abstract paintings during my senior year or high school and during my first year at CCA. I love painting and I knew it was something I wanted to do forever, but I also wanted to explore other majors as well and take advantage of going to this college to learn something completely different. I decided to try out graphic design and starting from then I grew to love design and find an attachment towards it as well as painting.

    	I wanted to create a quilt that is very personal to me and I wanted it look like a digital abstract painting that focused mainly on color and texture because that was what I focused on in my real paintings. I love color and I love using color to express my feelings and I felt like the color choices I used shows my personality. I was really interested in layering color blocks over each other to create a messy and crazy work of art because I feel like that represents my personality and who I am. I incorporated abstract typography because It is something I am learning as a graphic designer and I wanted to combine fine arts and graphic design into this digital quilt. </p>
